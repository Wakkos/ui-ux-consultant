<h4>UI</h4>

<p>User Experience starts in the code, an optimal - fast loading website is the base for every website. I keep a semantic HTML through CSS, working with meta-data, pseudo-elements and many css features to maintain HTML as semantic as it can be, always focusing on accessibility.</p>

<p>That means test-test-test-&amp;-test. I love having as much devices as I can to test crossbrowser code and test User Experience. That’s why I use Ghostlab (or similar: Codekit IP browsing) as one of my main tools.</p>

<p>I study and evaluate how users feel about a system, looking at such things as ease of use, perception of the value of the system, utility, efficiency in performing tasks and so forth.</p>

<h4>CSS</h4>

<p>I create scalable and robust CSS, focusing in maintainability. I Apply DRY rules and some OOCSS (Not every time, CSS is still cascade) and I always comment my CSS with BEM comments.
I <em>usually</em> attach myself to <a href="https://github.com/Wakkos/CSS-Guidelines">these rules and guidelines</a> when coding CSS.</p>

<p>I use CSS frameworks, but I don’t like to use Bootstrap/Foundation or any other <em>design</em> framework. I think a framework should do your work easy, it is not meant to do ALL the work: Every project evolves in a different way and depending on its path the CSS is one way or another. Design Frameworks like Bootstrap/Foundation comes with <em>all</em> solutions and you end up having a lot of crap in your code, not forgetting you have to adapt to <em>others</em> way to write code.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Wakkos/Wakkos-CSS-Framework">Therefore I created my own CSS framework in Sass</a> - it was in Less but it had evolved -.
This framework comes with a pretty good style guide I like to adapt to the current project. Such style guide is <em>very</em> handful when Developers (or myself) adapts the front HTML/CSS code to the backend system. I like to go as quick as I can to code when we have an early visual design and then use Styleguides to provide both consistency and a backend adaptation tool.</p>

<h4>Consulting / Training</h4>

<p>I’ve always been passionate about sharing knowledge, thanks to others doing that I could learn what I know. I run a lot of courses online in <a href="http://escuela.it">Escuela.It</a> and offline with several organizations like <a href="http://adcv.com/">ADCV</a>. I run courses and workshops for companies from basic to expert/professional in-house , training their teams in Sass, Workflow or CSS methodologies.</p>

<h4><em>Weakness</em></h4>

<p>Even when I can handle myself with a lot of code, I’m not a programmer. I don’t develop JavaScript Apps or .NET/ASP handlers (but I know what they are). I can write basic PHP loops/conditionals or MySQL queries.
This means I can understand code, deal with it and know what to do with my front end  code to adapt it to the backend.</p>

<li><a href="http://baleeblu.es/">http://baleeblu.es/</a>Control all the web behavior, made the front end code, design and planning UX strategy for this international marketplace.</li>
<li><a href="http://coolway.com/">http://coolway.com/</a> UX/UI and coded HTML/CSS. It was a fun site, since we worked under a design point of view more than accessibility and performance due to company requirements: they only wanted to show it in their own iPads to possible products distributors.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ulanka.com/">http://www.ulanka.com/</a> I’m actually redesigning their website aiming to sell as much as they sale offline. This site particularly represents a back and forth fight, I have my preferences, of course, but they’re never unchallenged since clients and peers also have their preferences.</li>
