# Daniel Martínez
UIX Developer/Consultant

## Profile
 I’m a UIX Developer/Consultant, with broad experience running training courses/workshops for web design and development teams.

 I understand CSS and its importance for projects scalability, I code it, I [design frameworks](https://github.com/Wakkos/Wakkos-CSS-Framework) for it, I create the best possible web performance along the most optimal code. I use with under a progressive enhancement / OOCSS / DRY techniques to provide a robust code.

## Language Skills
- Spanish: Native
- English: Fluent both Oral & Written
- Italian: lower intermediate level (still studying)

## Knowledge

### Coding Tools:
- Sublime Text
- Codekit
- Ghostlab
- Git

###  Skills and Working Methods:
- Responsive design
- Design courses and workshops
- Interactive prototyping
- Improve companies design process

#### UI
User Experience starts in the code, an optimal - fast loading website is the base for every website. I keep a semantic HTML through CSS, working with meta-data, pseudo-elements and many css features to maintain HTML as semantic as it can be, always focusing on accessibility.

That means test-test-test-&-test. I love having as much devices as I can to test crossbrowser code and test User Experience. That’s why I use Ghostlab (or similar: Codekit IP browsing) as one of my main tools.

I study and evaluate how users feel about a system, looking at such things as ease of use, perception of the value of the system, utility, efficiency in performing tasks and so forth.

#### CSS
I create scalable and robust CSS, focusing in maintainability. I Apply DRY rules and some OOCSS (Not every time, CSS is still cascade) and I always comment my CSS with BEM comments. 
I _usually_ attach myself to [these rules and guidelines](https://github.com/Wakkos/CSS-Guidelines) when coding CSS.

I use CSS frameworks, but I don’t like to use Bootstrap/Foundation or any other _design_ framework. I think a framework should do your work easy, it is not meant to do ALL the work: Every project evolves in a different way and depending on its path the CSS is one way or another. Design Frameworks like Bootstrap/Foundation comes with *all* solutions and you end up having a lot of crap in your code, not forgetting you have to adapt to _others_ way to write code.

[Therefore I created my own CSS framework in Sass](https://github.com/Wakkos/Wakkos-CSS-Framework) - it was in Less but it had evolved -.
This framework comes with a pretty good style guide I like to adapt to the current project. Such style guide is _very_ handful when Developers (or myself) adapts the front HTML/CSS code to the backend system. I like to go as quick as I can to code when we have an early visual design and then use Styleguides to provide both consistency and a backend adaptation tool.

#### Consulting / Training
I’ve always been passionate about sharing knowledge, thanks to others doing that I could learn what I know. I run a lot of courses online in [Escuela.It](http://escuela.it) and offline with several organizations like [ADCV](http://adcv.com/). I run courses and workshops for companies from basic to expert/professional in-house , training their teams in Sass, Workflow or CSS methodologies. 

#### _Weakness_
Even when I can handle myself with a lot of code, I’m not a programmer. I don’t develop JavaScript Apps or .NET/ASP handlers (but I know what they are). I can write basic PHP loops/conditionals or MySQL queries.
This means I can understand code, deal with it and know what to do with my front end  code to adapt it to the backend.

## Cool projects I’ve done
- [http://parquewarner.com](http://parquewarner.com) Designed the Website, then it was coded into Joomla.
-  [http://baleeblu.es/](http://baleeblu.es/)Control all the web behavior, made the front end code, design and planning UX strategy for this international marketplace.
-  [http://coolway.com/](http://coolway.com/) UX/UI and coded HTML/CSS. It was a fun site, since we worked under a design point of view more than accessibility and performance due to company requirements: they only wanted to show it in their own iPads to possible products distributors. 
-  [http://www.ulanka.com/](http://www.ulanka.com/) I’m actually redesigning their website aiming to sell as much as they sale offline. This site particularly represents a back and forth fight, I have my preferences, of course, but they’re never unchallenged since clients and peers also have their preferences.
